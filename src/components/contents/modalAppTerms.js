                11.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA
                to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or
                our obligations under this EULA.

                11.3 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your
                obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights
                against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that
                we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you
                do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a
                default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not
                mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
